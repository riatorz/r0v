# ARDOV :star:
I was the TEKNOFEST 2020 IEEE BAUN SUALTI CANAVARLARI team member and i was the programmer. I was used RaspberryPi3.
## MANUAL
I controlled the ROV with a joystick :video_game: (**There is a lot of input lag. I do not recommend using this way.**)
___
#### I was used DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor and included in the code.
## Install DHT11 and others..
```
pip install DHT11
pip install pygame
pip install pigpio
```
## AUTOMATION
  Just shared my image processing and detecting codes. This part not include about moving algorithms.
  **To adapt to all workspaces, the program has trackbars and counters.**
  ```
pip install opencv
pip install cvui
```
